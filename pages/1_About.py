st.markdown("""The Data Engineers' Coding Challenge was started at the ABS with the following aims:
            - To encourage staff to develop coding and data skills
            - To provide fun and interactive challenges where the most experienced coders don't (always) win
            - To strengthen the community of data professionals across the ABS and encourage collaboration
            
            We encourage coders of all abilities to participate in our monthly coding challenges. Submissions can range from 1 to 100+ lines, and involve a creative, fail-fast approach to problem solving. 
            
            Typically, results are broadcast live at Friday, 3 PM AEST/ADST, where we go through the submissions received and run the game live. 

            See you in the next one! 
            """
