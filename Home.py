"1. Game grid: The challenge will take place on a grid of size (width * height), given as a tuple of integers."
"2. Entities: Each data engineer will be represented by an emoji on the game board that bears their name and follows their function's logic. The beast will be represented by a ðŸ‘¹ emoji. If the beast reaches the same grid space as an engineer, they will become a zombie, represented by a ðŸ§Ÿ emoji, and the entity logic will follow that of the beast."
"3. Objective: Survive as long as possible! The game will continue until a pre-determined time limit, OR until there is only 1 engineer remaining."
"4. Scoring: The challenge will be played a total of three times to ensure that results are not determined entirely by luck! The first engineer to become a zombie will receive 1 point, the second will receive 2 and so on. Any engineers remaining at end game will receive a bonus 3 points."
"5. Movement: The challenge is turn based with each engineer able to move one grid-space per turn (up, down, left, right). The beast will start slow but gradually pick up the pace and will eventually move one EXTRA space every five turns. Zombies move slower, moving once every two turns. Note: Multiple entities may occupy the same space at once"
"6. Detection Radius: Engineers have full visibility over the office (the game board) and are given the positions of themselves, plus all the other engineers and beast/zombies. The beast and any zombies have a detection radius of 5, calculated using the Euclidean distance between entities"

st.markdown("""
- `self_pos` (Position): The current position of Alice on the grid, represented as a tuple (x, y).
- `beast_positions` (List[Position]): A list of tuples, each representing the position of a beast/zombie (x, y). The position of the beast is always at the first index position in the list. 
- `other_engineers` (List[Position]): A list of tuples, each representing the position of another engineer (x, y). This list may be empty if no other engineers are present.
- `grid_size` (Tuple[int, int]): A tuple representing the dimensions of the grid (width, height).

- Step 1: Code a helper function to determine if a move is valid (i.e. always within the grid boundaries)
- Step 2: Implement logic to move your engineer away from the beast/zombies
- Step 3 (Optional): Consider how you could use the positions of other engineers to your advantage
