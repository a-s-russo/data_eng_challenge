If the beast reaches the same grid space as an engineer, they will become a zombie, represented by a ðŸ§Ÿ emoji, and the entity logic will follow that of the beast.")

st.write("4: Scoring: The challenge will be played a total of three times to ensure that results are not determined entirely by luck! The first engineer to become a zombie will receive 1 point, the second will receive 2 and so on. Any engineers remaining at end game will receive a bonus 3 points.")
st.write("5. Movement: The challenge is turn based with each engineer able to move one grid-space per turn (up, down, left, right). The beast will start slow but gradually pick up the pace and will eventually move one EXTRA space every five turns. Zombies move slower, moving once every two turns. Note: Multiple entities may occupy the same space at once")
